# Vehicle Models of CommonRoad

This repository contains all vehicle models of the [CommonRoad benchmarks](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/). 

We provide implementation examples in MATLAB and Python, routines to convert initial states and parameters, simulation examples to demonstrate the advantages of more complicated models, and a detailed documentation.

## Installation and Tests (Python)

To use vehicle models and parameters, add the folder `Python` to your PYTHONPATH. If you are using PyCharm, this can be set through File->Settings->Project Interpreter->Show all->Edit

To execute a test function, which produces the plots of the vehicle models documentation, run 'testVehicle.py'.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute new vehicle models, you can create a merge request or contact us per [e-mail](mailto:commonroad-i06@in.tum.de).
